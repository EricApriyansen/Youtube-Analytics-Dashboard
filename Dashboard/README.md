# Youtube Analytic Dashboard

## Main Purpose

The dashboard's purpose is to show summarized analysis information in a single page graphic interface report. There are two types of information shown: performance statistics (historical) and viewers amount estimation (forecasting). 

## Suggestion

The main menu (Introduction page) is created to ease the experience of using the dashboard. Users may simply click on the button menu to surf through the targeted pages. Additionally, it is recommended to access the "Dashboard Guidance" page. Detailed explanation on how to effectively use the dashboard, getting the analytics results, and access the data table can be shown from this page.
