# History

The Assumption Test After Outlier 2 work in process are divided into two parts:

### Before SPSS Testing

Once the test samples were reduced to 383, another regression model was created in excel. The result is similar to the previous Outlier 1 regression model. The same case happened when the author tried to analyse the scatter plot chart, there is an indication of a positive skew line. To fix or normalize the distribution of datasets, the author had to use logarithm transformation. 

### After SPSS Testing

With the log transformation and polynomial fitting still violate the assumption test, the author had finally decided to use SPSS. Surprisingly, the model which presumed to hold a positive skew trend was not found in the test result. Datasets are distributed along the linear path from the scatterplot model. Further tests on the model shown no violation of multicollinearity, independence, and heteroskedasticity. Thus, the author had finally chosen the After Outlier 2 model for predicting the number of viewers.
