# History

There are two significant changes from the new regression model:
  1. R-square has increase to 96% from 93%
  2. All of the predictors p-value are below 0.05
  
Nevertheless, from the normal distribution test using Z-Score and residual scatterplot, there is an indication of positive skewness (bias) from the datasets. Another studentized residuals were calculated and five more data were identified as outliers, and will be excluded from the next test.
