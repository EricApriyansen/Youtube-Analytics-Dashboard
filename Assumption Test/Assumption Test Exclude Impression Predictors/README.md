# History

All of the p-values have scores below 0.05 except for the intercept. 

A Scatter plot graph was built to see the distribution of datasets. Datasets are shown to have some skewness on both tails (i.e. Heavy-Tailed Distribution). The author then checked for the studentized residuals to see the impact of the outliers. There are six data found to have SResid or studentized residuals above 3. The author then chose to categorize those as outliers and redo the assumption test.

#### Notes: Outliers data is listed in the "Outliers Table" files
