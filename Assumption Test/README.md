# Assumption Test Guidance

Mainly created to test if the multiple linear regression model for predictive analytics is good enough to be applied on the future datasets (i.e. evaluate the model). There are four types of assumptioni tests:
  1. The residuals are <b>Normally Distributed</b>
  2. The residuals are independent from one another <b>(Auto Correlation)</b>
  3. The residuals have equal variances <b>(Heteroskedasticity)</b>
  4. The Independent Variables / Predictors are not correlated with one another <b>(Multicollinearity)</b>
  
Any violation from one of the rules above may indicates a bias on the model. Further info for assumption violation impacts on the model can be check on [here](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/145/)
