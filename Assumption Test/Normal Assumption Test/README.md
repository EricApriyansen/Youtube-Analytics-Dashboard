The author tried to predict what factors might affect the rise and decline of viewers (i.e. dependent variable/response)  amount from the 394 samples of data. Based on the youtube analytics clean data table, six factors were chosen: Subscribers, Watch Time (In Minutes), Impression, Click Rate, Likes, and Dislikes (i.e. independent variables/predictors).

Data Analysis Toolpack used for the simple regression test. Based on the regression model, the r square value is around 93%, which indicates this model could explain the future datasets with high accuracy. Nonetheless, most of the P-value is above 0.05 except for Impression variables. In other words, the impression values might not have a significant effect on the views amount. Therefore, it is decided to rerun the test by excluding the Impression predictors.
