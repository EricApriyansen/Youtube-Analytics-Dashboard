# History

Log Transformation was firstly used on dependent variables (Views). However, the results have violated the basic principle of linear regression where the model displayed a non-linear path. The author then decided to test the log transformation on the predictors, continued by transforming all of the variables on a different regression test. Both results are either curvature or other non-linear patterns on the scatter plot graph. Therefore, the author then decided to fit the model into a polynomial regression instead.
